# Food Scanner!
Food Scanner is a web application that allows users to upload an image of their food and returns a list of its ingedients, allowing them to identify potentially hazardous ingredients that could trigger allergies or contain other ingredients in dietary restrictions. The webapp also displays the likeliness(in a percentage) of each predicted ingredient.

This application has been made at MHacks 11 with the help of Clarifai's food model.
